    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>2. Tracking & App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h2>
    <p>We may collect and link certain data (such as name, email, or usage activity) with third-party services to measure performance or improve features. This may be considered "tracking" under Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency framework.</p>
    <p><strong>Before any tracking occurs, we will request your explicit permission via the iOS AppTrackingTransparency prompt.</strong> You can choose to allow or deny tracking at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We integrate with third-party services such as OCR, barcode scanning, notifications, and analytics. These services process data according to their own privacy policies and, where applicable, after you have given tracking consent through ATT.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Security</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as needed and apply encryption and access control to safeguard it.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
